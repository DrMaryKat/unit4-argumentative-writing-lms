### 🎓 For Conference Participants (AAC&U 2026)
Experience the complete student learning journey and see how "courageous care" translates into practical, evidence-based instruction that honors student diversity while maintaining academic rigor.

### 📊 Research Context
This work addresses the "uncomfortable truth" that traditional writing curricula assume students possess sophisticated ethical reasoning skills they were never explicitly taught. The STEP framework makes these implicit skills teachable and accessible to all learners.
